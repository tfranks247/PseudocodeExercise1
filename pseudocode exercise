2. How much water runs off the roof
How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?
To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).
Write the pseudocode for the above problem. If you use the numbers provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.

Pseudocode:

Prompt user to determine dimensions of roof
Prompt user to convert dimensions into inches
Prompt user to multiply roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall
Prompt user to divide the result by the number of cubic inches in 1 gallon
